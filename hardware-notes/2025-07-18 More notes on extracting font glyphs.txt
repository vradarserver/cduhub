End of the large font seems to be denoted by a 3c packet that has
bit information and then pads out with zeros:

f000 a4 3c 0006fffffefffffefffffe00<pad to end with zeros>

Then there are three f0 00 xx 3c packets of all zeros
Then there is this 32 bb in a 12 packet:

f000 a8 12 0032bb000005010000729206000100<pad to end with zeros>

Then there's another three all-zero packets, this time with a type of
f0 01 xx 00, which is the usual padding packet sequence.

Then this 3c packet with a 32 bb preamble, but unlike previous examples the 0c02 is different:

f000 aa 3c 32bb00000701000088920600004801000005000000002800003c0100<pad to end with zeros>
compare:   32bb00000701000072920600000c020000050000000026000000020000
 
Then 4.5 ish packets of zeros - unusually a 32 bb starts towards the end of the 5th:

<45 bytes of zero> 32bb00000501000089920600010000

A bunch of other packets and then the next f0 00 xx 3c seems to have 1.5 32 bb blocks on it:

f000 b2 3c 32bb0000060100009a92060000190000000600000017001d005b0000007400000000000000552900000032bb0000070100009a920600000c02000006

Isolating those:

32bb0000060100009a92060000190000000600000017001d005b00000074000000000000005529000000
32bb0000070100009a920600000c02000006

the second half of the second 32bb is at the start of the next packet, and together they seem to
indicate the start of the small font glyph stream:

f000 b3 3c 000000000000000002000020<zeros to end of packet, but they're the bits for the space char).

Gluing the two 32 bb halves together and showing last 32 bb from large glyph for comparison:

The 32bb..0601 block is interesting, as that was the sole occupant of the first font packet, albeit on
a different 4th byte type:

f000 cd 2a 32bb000006010000be9006000019000000 05 00000017001d005b00000074000000000000005529000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
..                                            FI                                                 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
f000 b2 3c 32bb0000060100009a9206000019000000 06 00000017001d005b0000007400000000000000552900000032bb0000070100009a920600000c02000006

I remember seeing font IDs 5 and 6 in the JSON for the font, so I think FI is at least one byte of font ID,
and distinguishes between large and small.


So I think basically if we only care about font glyph bitmaps then we can follow these rules:

1. Look for f0 00 xx 2a as the start of font marker.

2. Within that packet look for a 32bb...0601 block and read the font ID from offset 11
   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11
   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
   32 bb 00 00 06 01 00 00 be 90 06 00 00 19 00 00 00 05 +24 bytes
   05 = large font follows
   06 = small font follows

3. Look for a 32bb...0701 block in an fc 00 xx 3c packet and skip past it:
   00 01 02 03 04 05
   -- -- -- -- -- --
   32 bb 00 00 07 01 + 23 bytes

4. Glyphs are only in f0 00 xx 3c packets.

4. Each glyph starts with a 4 byte unicode codepoint (which is ignored by the device?) and then
   29 triplets of three bytes. The three bytes describe the 1 bpp 23 pixel row with the lsb
   discarded by the device.

5. Each glyph follows on from the next with no padding.

6. The f0 00 xx 3c stream is occasionally interrupted by an f0 00 xx 12 packet.

7. The first byte after the f0 00 xx 12 is a part of the current glyph.

8. Ignore the rest of the xx 12 packet, and the subsequent f0 01 xx 00 packets. I think they might
   be padding to give the device time to process what's been sent so far?

9. Continue until you see a codepoint of 0000. The font is complete.

10. Start looking for another 32bb...0601, but this time in a fc 00 xx 3c packet.

11. The following 32bb...0701 might be within the same fc 00 xx 3c packet as the 32bb..0601. There
    will not be enough room for it, in which case it will continue into the next 3c packet.

12. Once you see the end of the 32bb...0701 packet resume processing as per above.

13. Once you see the second codepoint 0000 then you are done.

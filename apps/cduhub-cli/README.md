# CDU Hub Command-Line Interface

This runs the CDU Hub library from the command-line. It has no GUI and so
it should work under any operating system.



## Usage

`cduhub-cli.exe <command> <options>`

If no command is specified then `run` is assumed.



## Commands

### run

This runs the CDU Hub. By default it connects to the first CDU device that
it can find.

The program will keep running until you either press Q on the console or
use the QUIT option on the CDU device.
